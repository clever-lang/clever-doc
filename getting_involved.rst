Getting involved!
====================================

The *Clever Team* is usually on-line at IRC #clever (irc.freenode.net)

Never have tried IRC? Test it! http://webchat.freenode.net/

Mailing list
-----------------

Our mailing list is http://groups.google.com/group/clever-lang

We have a lot of talks on IRC, but It's nice to register some debats on
the group!

Documentation
---------------

Help us revising and writing docs!

Core Development
-------------------

Coding standards
###################

We mostly code based on the *Google C++ Style Guide* [#f1]_, which seems sane
enough.
The *LLVM* [#f2]_ one is also quite nice.

.. epigraph::

  Use the .cc extension for C++ source files and .h for C++ headers,
  hopefully your compiler is smart enough to identify C++ source inside
  a .h (don't worry, GCC and Clang are!). Oh, I almost forgot, please
  use tabs instead of spaces, UTF-8 file encoding and UNIX file endings
  (Line feed a.k.a. \n).

If you don't know how to contribute, but know how to code, it'd be nice if you
could implement one of the ideas from our whishlist:
