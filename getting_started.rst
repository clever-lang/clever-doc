(object-oriented, imperative) programming language written in *C++*.
It aims to have a small footprint and supply a useful set of features,
many seen in other languages.

Building

To build Clever is easy, you will need to have *CMake* [1] installed.
Enter in the clever source directory and run ``cmake .``

In this stage, you can help the *Clever Team* also by running ``make
run-tests`` and reporting to us if you get some failures!
